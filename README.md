> The simple REST server component of the ultrasonic emitter

## What is the project?

The Ultrasonic Emitter Server product is a simple server that provides a REST middleware/proxy for remote controlling the Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 development board, the Adafruit Latching Mini Relay FeatherWing, and the Dog Bark Deterrent by myskunkworks.net. The sister products are Ultrasonic Emitter Node and Ultrasonic Emitter App.

## What is the MVP?

The minimal valuable product is a server that turns the emitter on and off.

## What are the nice to haves?

The nice to haves for this project obtain the current state, set an expiration when the emitter automatically switches off, and reboot the server.

## When will the project be complete?

The project will be complete once the server is successfully proxying commands between the app and the node.
